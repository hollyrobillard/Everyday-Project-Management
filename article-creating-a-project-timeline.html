        <p>
          Two facts are true about every project:
          <ul>
					<li>There is never enough time to get everything done.</li>
          AND
          <li>Work expands to fill the time you give it.</li>
				</ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The perfect project timeline ensures that everyone has just enough
          time to complete the work – with a little float (aka, buffer) to cover
          any unexpected problems – but not so much time that the scope can be
          perfected beyond the requirements.
        </p>
			</section>
      <section id="objective">
				<h3>The Project Timeline's Objective</h3>
				<p>
					A project timeline serves two purposes: first, it determines whether
					your scope can be completed by the project deadline, under the required
					budget; and second, it serves as a method for measuring whether the
					project’s activities are being completed fast enough to ensure that the
					project finishes on time. 
				</p>
				<p>
				An effective project timeline documents: 
				<ul>
					<li>What gets done</li>
					<li>In what order</li>
					<li>By what date</li>
					<li>And by whom</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			</section>
			<section id="approach">
				<h3>Approach to Creating a Project Timeline</h3>
				<p>Creating a project timeline is a team effort; it’s not something a project manager can do alone. Ideally, you would get everyone in a room together to build the timeline but that may not be practical given the hybrid workplace and how full everyone’s calendars are.</p>
				<p>Project timelines happen after project chartering and after the scope is defined. </p>
			</section>
			<section id="steps-intro">
				<h3>Steps to Building a Project Timeline</h3>
				<p>There are several methods for building timelines. Here's one that works for most IIN projects:</p>
			</section>
				<section id="steps">
					<h4>Step 1: Identify the teams who will own parts of the project.</h4>
					<p>Think through your project from start to end and what the deliverables are.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Will you need Design services or Video services?</li>
						<li>Will someone from the Web Services team need to update a web page?</li>
						<li>Could your project cause additional calls for Student Success or Sales?</li>
						<li>Will Legal need to approve any aspect of your project?</li>	
						<li>Who needs to approve the deliverables from your project? This may be one person (ex: Legal approval of an agreement, a copyeditor reviewing your copy) or a group of people (a selection of sales agents testing a new enrollment flow).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Each of these groups are your stakeholders and will have input into your project plan.</p>
					<hr />
					<h4>Step 2: Talk to each of the team leads about:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>The scope of the project</li>
						<li>Their deliverables or role</li>
						<li>High-level key dates (aka, milestones) from the project charter.</li>
						<li>Other information you will need to provide for them to map out their timeline.</li>
					</ul>
					<hr />
					<h4>Step 3: Ask the team leads to provide this information for each of their project-related activities.</h4>
					<p>How you collect these will depend on their role and the nature of the activity. For a senior stakeholder who will approve various deliverables, you may collect this information verbally; a team with more deliverables or more complex activities may provide a spreadsheet.</p>
				<div class="table">
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-3 text-center">Activity or Task Name</div>
						<div class="col-9">
							Generally, it is a good idea to have separate line items for: 
							<ul>
								<li>Work being done by different people (for example, Person A purchases the ingredients and Person B mixes the dough)</li>
								<li>Work that is separated by time (for example, the ingredients are purchased on Monday and the dough is mixed on Friday)</li>
							</ul>
							Any more detailed than that may be too detailed. It depends on the nature of the project and the people who are involved.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-3 text-center">Dependencies</div>
						<div class="col-9">
							What would have to be in place before they could start work?
							<ul>
								<li>This may be something specific to how the work gets done, such as a creative brief or a JIRA ticket or approval by someone on their team.</li>
								<li>Or it could be something tactical, like they can’t start to mix the cookie dough until the ingredients have been purchased by the purchasing team; or until the oven gets fixed.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-3 text-center">Lead Time</div>
						<div class="col-9">
								How far in advance you need to warn them that the work is coming
								<ul>
									<li>Some departments can take in work right away</li>
									<li>Others require several weeks' notice to integrate your request into the other work they have already planned.</li>
								</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-3 text-center">Duration</div>
						<div class="col-9">
							The time span that the work will extend through
							<br />
							<br />
							There is often confusion between duration and effort. Here’s an example that tells the difference. Let’s say you’re baking cookies.
							<ul>
								<li>It takes you 30 minutes to mix the dough and put the cookies on a pan. That 30 minutes is the effort.</li>
								<li>But then the cookies bake for 10 minutes and cool for 20 minutes, making the total duration for baking the cookies 1 hour: 30 minutes to get the cookies ready to go into the oven + 30 minutes baking and cooling time.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-3 text-center">Effort</div>
						<div class="col-9">
								How many hours or resources completing the work will take
								<ul>
									<li>This could inform your budgeting process – if you expected to ask for 10 hours of support from Design but they are projecting 40 hours, that will reduce the budget available for other activities.</li>
									<li>For more on estimating work efforts, see Everyday Project Management: PERT Charts</li>
								</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-3 text-center">Sequencing</div>
						<div class="col-9">
								Any activities that need to happen in a specific order
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-3 text-center">Resource Availability</div>
						<div class="col-9">
								Any conflicts with other projects or time conflicts that the department has, such as planned parental leave for key players, or times that the team is unavailable or partially available due to other responsibilities, such as month-end close.
								<br />
								<br />
								It is the Team Lead’s responsibility to let you know if you will need to provide additional resources to supplement their staffing based on their other priorities and resource availability.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-3 text-center">Owners</div>
						<div class="col-9">
								Who will do each piece of work 
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
						<em>Working Back-to-Front</em>
						<p>It is often easiest, when building a timeline, to work backwards from the final step. This allows you to identify your start dates based on when things need to finish. For example:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>3:00 – Cookies delivered to bake sale</li>
							<li>2:30 – Left house with cookies</li>
							<li>2:15 – Cookies packed in boxes</li> 
							<li>2:00 – Cookies decorated</li>	
							<li>1:30 – Cookies cooled</li>	 
							<li>1:00 – Cookies baked</li>
							<li>12:30 – Cookies mixed and put on pans</li> 
							<li>12:00 – Ingredients measured out</li>	
							<li>10:30 – Ingredients purchased and oven turned on to pre-heat</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Step 4: Once you have collected the information from the various team members, integrate them into a single plan.</h4>
						<p>As you work, highlight:</p>
				<div class="table-2">
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-3 text-center">Conflict</div>
						<div class="col-9">For example, when Team A says they need something at the start of the project but Team B says they can’t deliver it until later in the project.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-3 text-center">Gaps</div>
						<div class="col-9">Such as a dependency that a team has that isn’t supplied by another team. For example, Team A may say that they require a script, but no other team may have creating the script on their list.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-3 text-center">Scope Changes</div>
						<div class="col-9">For example, a project to move data from one data warehouse to another may include building reports in an as-is state, but a team may try to sneak in improvements to the reports, which should be a separate project.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-3 text-center">Risks</div>
						<div class="col-9">Activities that will cause the project to take longer or cost more than originally planned.</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<br />
				<p>As much as possible, try to organize tasks so that they fall into the appropriate project phase:</p>
				<div class="table-3">
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col text-center">Preparation</div>
						<div class="col text-center">Planning</div>
						<div class="col text-center">Execution</div>
						<div class="col text-center">Launch*</div>
						<div class="col text-center">Wrap-Up</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
							<div class="col">
									What happens before project starts, such as budgeting and scheduling. 
									<br />
									<br />
									Project team is identified. 
							</div>
							<div class="col">
									Work is planned and approved.  
									<br />
									<br />
									Decisions about scope and how the work will get done are finalized.
							</div>
							<div class="col">
									The work is completed according to the project plan.
							</div>
							<div class="col">
									The work is evaluated by stakeholders and prepared for distribution to end-users. 
									<br />
									<br />
									Training 
									<br />
									Pilot 
									<br />
									Launch 
							</div>
							<div class="col">
									Work is evaluated for future learnings. 
									<br />
									<br />
									Ongoing support is handed off to operations.  
									<br />
									<br />
									Project ends. 
							</div>
						</div>
						* Many project managers include launch activities in Execution and instead include a Monitor & Control phase that happens in parallel to all other phases. However, when you are working on launch activities, the nature of the work and the participants shift enough that it warrants a dedicated phase.
				</div>
						<h4>Step 5: Meet with the team leads as a group to review the plan in detail and work through the conflicts, gaps, and scope changes.</h4>
						<p>As the project manager, your job is to document the final decisions and ask questions that force people to think about the work a different way.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>For example, when someone says it’s impossible to get the work done any faster, ask them what would make it possible – reduced scope? more money for people or outsourcing?</li>
							<li>Often people think about working sequentially instead of working in parallel, which can save time but may require more resources. Or they misunderstand (or are inflating) the scope.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Look for opportunities for work to overlap – can the next person in the sequence start prepping before the final deliverable moves to them? Does the Video team, for example, need the final script from Marketing before they can schedule the shoot?</p>
						<h4>Step 6: Assess the impact on the timeline, budget, and scope and discuss with your sponsor.</h4>  
						<p>If you need to ask your sponsor for more budget or time, or to adapt the scope, it is best to do this at the start of the project, not when everything blows up later.</p>
						<h4>Step 7: Require all team leads and the sponsor to approve the timeline in writing.</h4>
						<p>This sets the formal line in the sand: after this point, any changes that negatively impact the project timeline require a change request.</p>
